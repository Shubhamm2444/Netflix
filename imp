Explanation:

1:Search Functionality (Placeholder):
Attaches an event listener to the search button.
Displays an alert message indicating search functionality is not implemented yet. You'll need to replace this with actual search logic using JavaScript and potentially APIs.

2:Profile Dropdown Menu (Placeholder):
Selects the profile button and dropdown menu elements.
Adds a click event listener to the profile button.
Toggles the active class (defined in your CSS) on the dropdown menu, effectively showing or hiding it on click.

3:Content Carousels (Optional):
Selects the unordered list containing trending content.
Defines a currentSlide variable to track the currently displayed slide.
The showSlide function takes a slide number n as input and:
Handles edge cases (going beyond the first or last slide).
Removes the active class from all slides.
Adds the active class to the specified slide (based on currentSlide).
Buttons for navigation (optional) are added with event listeners to call showSlide with the next or previous slide index.
The initial slide is displayed using showSlide(currentSlide).
